## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Development

**Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS  
**AI API:** Google Gemini Pro Vision  
**Authentication:** (Planned) Clerk / Auth0 for user accounts  
**Deployment:** Vercel  
**Development Tools:** Cursor, GitHub Copilot, v0.dev

This project was built using a modern, AI-assisted development workflow:
- **v0.dev** was used to rapidly generate initial UI components, accelerating development.
- **Cursor** and **GitHub Copilot** assisted with boilerplate code and implementation details.
- This approach allowed a solo developer to focus on crafting the core user experience, AI integration, and solving the core problem within a constrained 24-hour timeframe.
